    <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
    <p>I constantly find myself questioning in my day to day life how many common tasks are completed. Such as how does a myki machine top up my myki, how is data being stored on my computer, what is the metaverse. As time progressed I started to realize that a lot of the questions I have are related to IT, I specifically am more interested in the convenience that IT is bringing to many common practices. I was about a month away from my final year 12 exams when I couldn't sleep one night, as I was scrolling through YouTube this video was recommended for me "I spent 100 days in the metaverse". As I watched this video my interest in the transition to technology became even more fascinating to me and I started to really consider IT. Since I was 14 I was positive that I would be doing something related to politics and commerce, in fact I was so sure that I actually didn't even consider putting any IT courses on my preference list for university. However the night before final submission was due for university course preferences I added an IT course, even though I have absolutely no IT experience.</p>

    <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
    <p>Growing up in a small city in New Zealand where the population is equivalent to approximately a 15th of Melbourne, I was used to a very different sort of lifestyle. I lived in an area where the central CBD was a single strip that you could walk through in about 10 min and anything interesting would close at around 8. Even though I've been in Melbourne for years, catching the train to the city still excites me. I'm in love with the RMIT campus location, the fact that after my classes on the way to the train station it's not odd for me to see someone sitting on the floor playing drums on a stack of Styrofoam and pot lids, or a grown man inside a large green balloon dancing around to music (events that I have actually witnessed on my way home from RMIT). I chose RMIT because I love the hustle and bustle around the campus, I love walking to the campus everyday and being able to study in a building which overlooks swarms of people hurriedly walking to their destinations and trams passing by while I try to figure out what the heck binary numbers are.</p>

    <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
    <p>At this stage I am very interested in the relationships technology has with politics. I want to learn more about how technological advancements will influence populations and state sovereignty. For example, currently I am interested in learning more about blockchain technology and how it revolutionizes global economies, more specifically how a decentralized systems will impact the current state of technology. Furthermore, I want to develop a deeper understanding of software programming and security, specifically using programs such as python (as its popularity grows and is implmented within a range of diffrent companies) so I know how to create basic websites or build software and understand how to identify risk assessments as well as protect my software against them. </p>
