    <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
    <p>These test results are an indicator of both my strengths and weaknesses, they showcase to me some desirable attributes when it comes to employment and teamwork while also highlighting aspects which I need to work on. Ultimately however these results also help me better understand myself and the most suitable forms of learning and work environments that make me feel my most comfortable and productive, however they are only an indication of my attributes as opposed to a cery accurate representation of my personality. </p>

    <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h3>
    <p>My results stated that I am more introverted than extroverted, this is something that can be an issue when working collaboratively since it may mean I have poor communication skills in some aspects and therefore limit my team's ability to achieve our goals effectively if we’re not on the same page. I have a high level of agreeableness which means that I have the ability to compromise within a team which can allow my team members to feel like their ideas are being heard and valued. One of my weaknesses stated in the myer briggs was closed mindedness, this can be difficult in a team by resulting in a loss of productivity or efficiency if I’m not open to others opinions or suggestions. </p>

    <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
    <p>When forming a team its important for me to not only to remain open minded to suggestions by understanding how ultimately this will lead to greater results and high levels of productivity however to achieve this strong communication is needed within a group. The result showcased how I am a visual learner, when forming a group I may pay attention to individuals who also have a similar learning style and therefore can collaborate better with them so that once the group has allocated of tasks, they can be distributed through possibly a table. I have a high level of judging as opposed to prospecting which can have some benefits when forming a group since it will mean completing tasks in a structured way as well as a variety of back up plans. However it can also mean limited flexibility for when unexpected challenges arise which is why when forming a group, I may want to seek someone who has a strong prospecting personality type to help create some sort of balance. </p>
