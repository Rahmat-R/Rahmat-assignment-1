    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>From my house, getting to the local major shopping center using public transport takes 1 hour and 17 minute which involves 2 buses, a train and a 1.5km walk. This is a trip that would take 18 minutes in a car. Public transport in Wyndham is set with a linear journey in mind. There is an expectation that anyone using public transport is just using it to get to the city. Given this, the majority of buses lead to the train station and all of the trains lead to the city. Furthermore, bus stops are incredibly inaccessible to many residents, the Age newspaper reported in 2018 that only 13% of Wyndham residents lived within 400m of a bus stop. This is an issue as there is no connectivity within or between suburbs in Wyndham through public transport. Wyndham is recognised as having the largest population growth in Victoria and second largest and fastest in Australia, meaning the issue of ineffective public transport is set to grow.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Pooler is an app that will help improve the local Wyndham communities' travels within the area more efficiently. Pooler is an app that will operate based on users within the postcodes of 3024 - 3211, once users download the app they will have to enter their postcode to be able to access the services. From here the user will decide whether they want to be a driver or a rider and from there select their destination. In this day and age, with technology rapidly expanding we constantly hear about the threat it poses to genuine human connection. Pooler is a community based app that will not only help in resolving public transport issues within the Wyndham but also help build stronger community relationships. Pooler will provide individuals greater convenience by allowing locals to access community hubs more efficiently while also building stronger neighborhood relationships.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Once a user downloads the app pooler they will firstly be provided with a page that will require them to enter their details. Here Pooler will request the users, residential address, their name, phone number and account details. Once the user has successfully filled in this information, they will receive verification of whether or not they are eligible to be using the apps services. For verification to be successful the user's residential address must be within a valid Wyndham postcode. Once verified users will be provided with the option as either a driver or a rider. If the driver option is chosen the app will ask them to input documents such as their: drivers licence, vehicle registration, background check, some form of proof of identification, profile photo, a driving record and also how many seats their car has. Pooler will then use the driver's current location and destination choice to connect them with riders within their area who have selected the same location. The driver will receive a message generated by the app which shows the map of the route with the number of stops pinned on the map based on who has requested a ride in that area. If the user choices the rider option, they will firstly be provided with a list of locations within Wyndham that they are able to choose from such as, school, shopping centres, train stations, libraries and hospitals/medical centres. Once a rider has selected their destination, based on their location pooler will connect them to the drivers closest to them who are also travelling to the same location. Once connected the rider will be sent a route of their journey and where stops will be made to pick up other riders as well as an estimated time of arrival to the location. Pooler will have special request features to ensure that riders feel most comfortable during their travels, riders will be able to add preferences wether they prefer a female or male driver, whether they need disability supported vehicle etc. Furthermore a users pooler journey will be recorded on the pooler app from start to finish to ensure both driver and rider safety, through monitoring the location of both users. For riders to identify Pooler drivers there will be a unique QR code provided to every driver that  will be updated by Pooler automatically for every new ride, once the rider has scanned the QR code they will receive a 4 digit number which they will have to provide to the driver to ensure verification. Once this process has been completed only then will the journey begin to be charged. The app will also include a community tab section where locals can communicate such as through providing feedback and suggestions for the app, this community tab can also be utilised as a place where local businesses within the area can upload advertisements of events taking place at their stores. Therefore Pooler will not only be helping support local businesses within the area by making services more accessible however, by also increasing the businesses customer base through these advertisements. </p>

    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>Require cloud storage to store the different locations offered by pooler and user data. Pooler may also use java script, specifically front end Javascript so that users can see and interact with the application directly. Pooler may use C++ and MySQL in relation to establishing its operating system. XML data may also be used when encoding the apps information for a range of different types of data such as database record, and may do this through JSON to run a more efficient interactive application.</p>

    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p>UI/UX skills (user interface and user experience) will be required in relation to the visual elements that users will interact with. Consistent business analysis will be required relating to ensuring that users' needs are being heard and catered to. A cloud infrastructure will be required to store all of the users information. To ensure security of Pooler and user information, it can undergo different security testing and encryptions.>
