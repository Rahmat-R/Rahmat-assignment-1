    <h4>Nationality:</h4>
    <p>Kiwi - I was born in New Zealand and then moved to Australia when when I was 11</p>
    <h4>Ethnicity: </h4>
    <p>Indian - Punjabi</p>
    <h4>Languages spoken:</h4>
    <p> Punjabi.
    My parents were so insistent that I learn Punjabi that they flew my grandmother from India when I was 3 to come live with us for a couple months, to ensure that I knew how to speak it. At the age of 5 I was only allowed to speak Punjabi at home and English at school. Now this was very confusing for 5 year old me, I would struggle with being able to translate some Punjabi words into English and vice versa. My accent for some words would also be absolutely atrocious, such as rather than saying lion I would pronounce it at loin since that is how (till this day) my dad pronounces it, same with the word pomegranate, which I pronounced as pong-ra-gate. I was 6 when I realized how much I hated presenting in front of people.</p>
    <h4>Education:</h4>
    <p> I graduated high school in 2021</p>
    <h4>Interesting fact:</h4>
    <p> My first job ever was as an extra in a movie called Shantaram, my VERY important role was to walk back and forward in front of a train while silently arguing to a fruit vendor about the price of his products being way too expensive. I did this for 10 hours on a very hot summer day.</p>
